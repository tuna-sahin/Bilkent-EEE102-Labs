In the making of this driver, I hooked up the servo motors to an arduino to drive them.
I then analysed the waveform for corresponding angles.
I noticed that the arduino sent a square pulse every 20 ms with varying lengths.
I used python to curve fit the angle values to the pulse lengths and found the formula:
550 + 10degree = pulse_length(Î¼s)
The rest is standart algorithm implementation in VHDL.
